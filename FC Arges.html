       <p>Fotbal Club Argeș Pitești  commonly known as FC Argeș or Argeș Pitești, is a Romanian professional football club based in Pitești, Argeș County, currently playing in the Liga II.</p>
       <p>Nicknamed "the White-Violet Eagles", the team was founded in 1953 as Dinamo Pitești. Its most successful period was in the 1970s, when it won the national championship twice. FC Argeș traditionally plays its home matches at the Nicolae Dobrin Stadium, which has a capacity of 15,000.</p>
       <p>After the bankruptcy of FC Argeș, people of Pitești have tried to bring football back to life. The first project was SCM Pitești, a project initiated by Pitești Municipality which created a football section at SCM, the Sporting Club of the Municipality, in 2011, with 2 years before the end of FC Argeș, anticipating the bankruptcy of the club led at that time by Penescu's son, a club full of debts and with no future. The team promoted at Liga III after only one season and remained at that level until 2017 when they promoted to Liga II.</p>
       <p>The supporters of FC Argeș encouraged the team until the very end, then after the bankruptcy they founded FC Argeș 1953 Piteşti, a phoenix club fully owned by FC Argeș supporters. The club won 2015–16 Liga IV-Argeș County and than the promotion play-off match against Recolta Stoicănești, Olt County champion, with the score of 5–2, but they couldn't join Liga III due to lack of funds and then dissolved the senior team.Then Pitești Municipality has shown the intention to buy FC Argeș's brand and the fans have also announced that they support this initiative.</p>
